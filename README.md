## What is it?

The Xbox 360 game store is a piece of homebrew for the Xbox 360 that allows games to be directly downloaded onto the Xbox 360.

## Requirements

* A JTAG/RGH hard modded console OR a console running BadUpdate/ABadAvatar
* The Xbox 360 must be connected to the internet

## **Not** Required

* Stealth Server
* Xbox Live
* Local web server

## How to use

1. Download free60-store.zip from the releases
2. Extract the .xex and settings.txt files from the ZIP file, and transfer them to your console
3. Set the output path for games in settings.txt. This will be where games will be extracted to
4. Launch it using your favourite file manager or dashboard
5. Search for your favourite game
6. Navigate the menu with ↑ and ↓
7. Select a game by pressing A
8. Select a version of the game
9. Press A to begin the download

Currently, this program supports downloading directly from Vimms Lair. While the download speeds can be slow, it contains a variety of games.

## Credits

Many thanks to all of the open source projects that made this possible, including:

* [XboxTLS](https://github.com/JakobRangel/XboxTLS) by JakobRangel, for encrypted HTTPS communication
* [Simple 360 Nand Flasher](https://github.com/Swizzy/XDK_Projects) by Swizzy, to use as a base project to work from, as well as providing a simple, easy to use interface to output console style text to the screen
* [extract-xiso](https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso) by XboxDev, modified to extract ISO files directly on the Xbox itself
* [LZMA SDK](https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html), to decompress LZMA and LZMA 2 compressed 7z files
* [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/), without which this entire project would not have been possible

## Disclaimers

* Firstly, while this program should not harm your Xbox 360 in any way, it is still in a very early alpha phase. As with all homebrew, run it at your own risk
* This program is in a very early alpha phase, and should be treated as a proof-of-concept. Bugs should be expected
* Depending on your local law, it may or may not be legal for you to download games with this tool. I take ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY for your actions
* AI. Yes, I used it. While this project is **not** vibecoded, there are many portions of this project where I made use of AI to **assist** in writing parts of the code
* This project has no intention of being affiliated with the free60 project. If you do not approve of this project's name, please let me know

## TODO

* Clean up the very messy code
* Optimise 7z decompression, potentially implimenting multithreading
* Eliminate memory leaks
* Impliment a better UI using xUI
* Add support to download from ROMSFUN using flaresolver proxy - unlikely
* Add support to download from the Internet Archive
* Potentially make use of the [triangle](https://github.com/JakobRangel/Triangle) frontend when it is made open source
* Test to see if DOS 8.3 file name limitations affect FATX
