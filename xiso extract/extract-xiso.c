		03.29.03 in:	Fixed a path display bug, changed the tree descent algorithm
						and added ftp to xbox support (rev to v1.2)

		04.04.03 in:	Added a counter for total number of files in xiso (rev to
						v1.2.1)  THIS VERSION NOT FOR RELEASE!

		04.18.03 in:	Added xoff_t typecasts for __u32 * __u32 manipulations.
						This fixed a bug with very large iso's where the directory
						table was at the end of the iso--duh! (rev to v1.3)

		04.19.03 in:	A user pointed out that the program is increasing its
						memory usage over large iso's.  I've tracked this to the buffer
						allocation in extract_file() during traverse_xiso()
						recursions.  As a fix I've moved the copy buffer to a static
						variable.  Not as encapsulated as I'd like but hey, this is
						C after all.

						Also added support for FreeBSD (on Intel x86) (rev to v1.4)

		04.21.03 in:	It looks like whomever is making xiso creation tools out there
						has never heard of a binary tree and is sticking *every*
						directory entry off the right subnode (at least on all the iso's
						I've found so far).  This causes extremely deep recursion for
						iso's with lots of files (and also causes these iso's, when
						burned to DVD, to behave as a linked list for file lookups, thus
						providing *worst case* lookup performance at all times).

						Not only do I find this annoying and extremely bad programming,
						I've noticed that it is causing sporadic stack overflows with
						my (formerly) otherwise good tree traversal code.

						In order to combat such bad implementations, I've re-implemented
						the traverse_xiso() routine to get rid of any non-directory
						recursion.  Additionally, I've made a few extra tweaks to
						conserve even more memory.  I can see now that I'm going to need
						to write xiso creation as well and do it right. (rev to v1.5 beta)
						NOT FOR RELEASE

		04.22.03 in:	Making some major changes...

						Working on the optimization algorithm, still needs some tweaks
						apparently.  DO NOT RELEASE THIS SOURCE BUILD!

						NOTE:  I'm building this as 1.5 beta and sending the source to
						Emil only, this source is not yet for release.

		04.28.03 in:	I've finally decided that optimizing in-place just *isn't* going
						to happen.  The xbox is *really* picky about how its b-trees
						are laid out.  I've noticed that it will read the directory if
						I lay the entries out in prefix order.  Seems kind of weird to
						me that it would *have* to be that way but whatever.  So, I guess
						I'll write xiso creation and then piggyback a rewrite type op
						on top of it.  Not quite as nice since it means you need extra
						disk space but such is life.

		05.01.03 in:	Well it looks like I got the creation code working tonight, what
						a pain in the ass *that* was.  I've been working on it in my free
						time (which is almost non-existent) for a week now, bleh.  Also
						decided to implement rewriting xisos and I think I'll add build
						xiso from ftp-server, just to be *really* lazy.  I guess this
						means I'll have to read the stat code in the ftp tree.  Hmmm,
						probably need to dig around in there anyway...  A user reported
						that newer builds of evox are barfing with ftp upload so I guess
						I'll go debug that.

						Also cleaned up the code quite a bit tonight just for posterity.
						I'd just like to point out that I *know* I'm being really lazy with
						all these big-ass functions and no header files and such.  The fact
						is I just can't seem to bring myself to care woohaahaa!

						(rev to 2.0 beta)  NOT FOR RELEASE until I get the other goodies
						written ;)

		05.03.03 in:	Added support for create xiso from ftp server.  Still need to debug
						evox to see what the problem is-- looks like something to do for
						tomorrow!

		05.06.03 in:	Finally got back to this little project ;0 -- the ftp bug was that
						FtpWriteBlock() in the libftp kit was timing out on occasion and returning
						less than a complete buffer.  So I fixed that and some other little
						bugs here and there, plus I changed the handling of the create mode
						so that you can now specify an iso name.  Hopefully that's a bit more
						intuitive.

		05.10.03 in:	Fixed a lot of stuff by now, I think it's solid for 2.0 release.
						(rev to 2.0, release)

		05.13.03 in:	Oops, fixed a bug in main() passing an (essentially) nil pointer to
						create_xiso that was causing a core dump and cleaned up the avl_fetch()
						and avl_insert() routines.  (rev to 2.1, release)

		05.14.03 in:	Added media check fix, fixed a bug in the ftp library where FtpStat was
						failing on filenames with spaces in them.

		06.16.03 in:	Based on code from zeek, I added support for win32, minus ftp
						functionality.  Neither he nor I have the time to port the ftp library
						to windows right now, but at least the creation code will work.  Big thanks
						to zeek for taking the time to wade through the source and figure out
						what needed to be tweaked for the windows build.

		06.20.03 in:	Well I just couldn't release the windows build without ftp support (can
						you say OCD <g> ;-), anyway I sat down today and ported the ftp library
						to win32.  That was a major pain let me tell you as I don't have a decent
						PC to run windows on (all my decent PC's run linux) and I've never really
						programmed anything on Windows.  Who'd have known that I couldn't just use
						fdcustomOpen() to convert a socket descriptor to a FILE *!  Anyway, whining aside
						I think it all works the way it's supposed to.  I'm sure once I throw it on
						the PC community I'll have plenty of bug reports, but such is life.  I also
						fixed a few other minor glitches here and there that gcc never complained
						about but that vc++ didn't like.

		07.15.03 in:	Fixed a bug first reported by Metal Maniac (thanks) where the path string was
						being generated improperly during xiso creation on windows.  Special thanks to
						Hydra for submitting code that mostly fixed the problem, I needed to make a few
						more tweaks but nothing much.  Hopefully this will solve the problem.  Also,
						thanks to Huge for doing a Win32 GUI around extract-xiso 2.2!  Rev to 2.3, release.

		07.16.03 in:	Changed some of the help text, looks like I introduced a copy-paste
						bug somewhere along the line.  Oops.

		07.28.03 in:	Added support for progress updating to create_xiso, now just pass in
						a pointer to a progress_callback routine (see typedef below).  Also added
						support on darwin for burning the iso to cd/dvd.  For some reason right now
						everything works fine if I try to burn an image to a DVD, but if I try to
						insert a cd it dies.  I have no idea as of yet what's wrong.  I am strongly
						considering *not* opensourcing my cd-burning stuff once I get it working
						as I can think of a few commercial uses for it.  Have to mull that one
						over a bit more.  This version only for release to UI developers.

		12.02.03 in:	Fixed a few bugs in the ftp subsystem and increased the read-write buffer size
						to 2Mb.  That should help ftp performance quite a bit.

		10.29.04 in:	Well, it's been a looooong time since I've worked on this little program...
						I've always been irritated by the fact that extract-xiso would never create an
						iso that could be auto-detected by CD/DVD burning software.  To burn iso's I've
						always had to go in and select a manual sector size of 2048 bytes, etc.  What
						a pain!  As a result, I've been trying to get my hands on the Yellow Book for
						ages.  I never did manage that as I didn't want to pay for it but I did some
						research the other day and came across the ECMA-119 specification.  It lays
						out the exact volume format that I needed to use.  Hooray!  Now xiso's are
						autodetected and burned properly by burning software...

						If you try to follow what I've done and find the write_volume_descriptors()
						method cryptic, just go download the ecma-119 specification from the ecma
						website.  Read about primary volume descriptors and it'll make sense.

						Bleh! This code is ugly ;-)

		10.25.05 in:	Added in  patch from Nordman.  Thanks.
						Added in security patch from Chris Bainbridge.  Thanks.
						Fixed a few minor bugs.

		01.18.10 aiyyo:	XBox 360 iso extraction supported.

		10.04.10 aiyyo:	Added new command line switch (-s skip $SystemUpdate folder).
						Display file progress in percent.
						Try to create destination directory.

		10.11.10 aiyyo:	Fix -l bug (empty list).

		05.02.11 aiyyo:	Remove security patch.

		09.30.11 somski: Added XGD3 support

		01.11.14 twillecomme: Intégration of aiyyo's and somski's work.
						Minor warn fixes.

	enjoy!
